# Discovery Physics Club

[to be edited]!!!




I was the co-executive and the chief peer tutor at my high school's physics club. At the beginning of grade 10, I signed up for the club and. I have been attentive to . At the end of grade 11, I decided to gather the other talented students and discuss my aim to let our school's team to score top 5 in Shenzhen in a wide range of Physics Olympiads of various levels, such as the AAPT physics bowl challenge, an international competition written by a couple hundreds or even thousands of people each year, so that we could win T-shirts :D 

e started planning for the following year's club meetings. We had numerous meetings each week. Moreover, we splitted up the topics so each of us can instruct to the general club(I was responsible for mechanics and electricy&magnetism) on the topics that we assigned ourselves to. Throughout my club tutorial sessions, I created my own problemsets and quizzes for the club members and I made announcements and summaries for those who missed the session. Finally, after we have discussed in detail every possible question from the past years' exams, and that we had a solid grasp of the physics knowledge required, our team scored 7th globally and 4th in North America. Moreover, two of our candidates were tied for the second place in Canada. Betteryet, we won T-shirts! This repository sums up the work I contributed to my high school's physics club. It was definitely a memorable/pleasing experience! The contest result info could be found at
